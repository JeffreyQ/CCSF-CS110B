 *
 *	One problem with this implementation is that it is unwieldy to add new creatures. Rewrite the class to use inheritance,
 *	which will eliminate the need for the variable "type". The creature class should be the base class. The classes demon,
 *	elf, and human should be derived from creature. The classes cyberdemon and balrog should be derived from demon.
 *	You will need to rewrite the getSpecies() and getDamage() functions so they are appropriate for each class.
